# Beavis CLI

Beavis CLI is a library which enables you to use a web-cli/terminal/console with your ASP.NET Core applications. It is very easy to configure and implement your own custom commands.

## Install

You can get the library from <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ooaavee.Xxxx">NuGet</a>.

```
PM> Install-Package Ooaavee.BeavisCli
```

## Basic configuration

It is very easy to configure your ASP.NET Core application to use the Beavis CLI library: Just add services to the container and configure the HTTP request pipeline in the application startup code.

```cs
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddBeavisCli();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseBeavisCli();
    }
}
```

That's all, voil√†! Just start your application and open the address `/terminal` in your web browser.
